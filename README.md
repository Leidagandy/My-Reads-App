## MyReads : A Book Finder App

MyReads allow users to search for books by entering a query (Title, Author, etc) and displays the resulting books in a list on the page with all the corresponding data. Books can then be placed in one of three shelves or categories:

    - Currently Reading
    - Want to Read
    - Read

Users can search for books based on the following terms:

"Android", "Art", "Artificial Intelligence", "Astronomy", "Austen",
"Baseball", "Basketball", "Bhagat", "Biography", "Brief", "Business",
"Camus", "Cervantes", "Christie", "Classics", "Comics", "Cook", "Cricket", "Cycling",
"Desai", "Design", "Development", "Digital Marketing", "Drama", "Drawing","Dumas",
"Education", "Everything", "Fantasy", "Film", "Finance", "First", "Fitness", "Football", "Future","Games", "Gandhi", "Homer","Horror", "Hugo",
"Ibsen", "JavaScript", "Journey", "Kafka", "King", "Lahiri", "Larsson", "Learn", "Literary Fiction", "Make", "Manage", "Marquez", "Money", "Mystery", "Negotiate",
"Painting", "Philosophy", "Photography", "Poetry", "Production", "Programming",
"React", "Redux", "River", "Robotics", "Rowling",
"Satire", "Science Fiction", "Shakespeare", "Singh", "Swimming", "Tale", "Thrun", "Time", "Tolstoy", "Travel","Ultimate", "Virtual Reality", "Web Development", "iOS";

This app is the first of three projects required to complete the Udacity's React Nanodegree program.

## Live Demo

https://my-reads-shelf-react-app.netlify.app/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instalation

Clone the repository, change directories, and use NPM to install the dependencies.

\$ git clone https://github.com/Leidagandy/My-Reads-App.git

\$ cd reactnd-project-myreads

\$ npm install

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
